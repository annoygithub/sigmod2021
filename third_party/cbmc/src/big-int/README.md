CPROVER is distributed with its own multi-precision arithmetic library;
mainly for historical and portability reasons. The library is externally
developed and thus `big-int` contains the source as it is distributed:
[http://www.dirk-zoller.de/](http://www.dirk-zoller.de/).

This should not be used directly, see `util/mp_arith.h` for the CPROVER
interface.
