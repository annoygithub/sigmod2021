This test contains two identically-named static functions in two
identically-named files in different directories. By default, the
name-mangling scheme would have the static functions identical names when
they got exported. This test ensures the functions each get a unique
suffix.

CBMC should work on the finally-linked binary because the functions have
been correctly mangled.
