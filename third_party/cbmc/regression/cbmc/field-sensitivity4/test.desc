Fields A::x and A::y should be referred to as atomic symbols (a..x and a..y) but not using
member operators (a.x and a.y).
Currently this generates a byte_update operation followed by field expansion; could be improved
if value_sett kept track of a finite set of constant offsets rather than degrading to unknown-offset
whenever multiple offsets into the same allocation are merged.
