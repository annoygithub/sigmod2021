^Function contains 2 single-entry, single-exit regions:$
^Region starting at \(2, [0-9]+\) x = 0; ends at \(10, [0-9]+\) 3: SKIP$
^Region starting at \(0, [0-9]+\) IF !\(argc % 5 != 0\) THEN GOTO 4 ends at \(14, [0-9]+\) 5: SKIP$
^EXIT=0$
^SIGNAL=0$

These regions cannot currently be identified because the function contains a loop with two backedges.
