This directory contains tests for the --static-values feature: reading initial
values of static fields from a JSON file.
Most of the tests are in StaticValues.java, some more tests are included in
Color.java, and all other classes are used to create instances of various kinds
of objects to use in the tests.
The initial static field values are read from the file clinit-state.json.
The script generate-json.sh (which calls org.cprover.JsonGenerator in the Maven
project) can be used to generate output similar to the contents of
clinit-state.json (with slightly less pretty-printing/newlines, which are not
supported in the custom writers and were manually added to clinit-state.json).
