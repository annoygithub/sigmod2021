Symex should have the values of all class_identifier fields in its constant
propagation map, so that it can run efficiently and create a simpler equation.
If an argument to the entrypoint is nondet-initialised using automatic local
initialisation then symex thinks its class identifier might be uninitialised,
and hence could be anything, because that's what happens in the null case (but
we never access the class identifier in this case). Hence we have switched to
dynamic allocation for this situation.
