The LVT in the only method in unexpected.class does not satisfy the constraints
expected by the bytecode to goto conversion algorithms. Namely, the live range
of parameter x in that method is not preceeded by a store_i instruction, which
is perfectly possibly as per the JVM specs but currently additionally required
in CBMC.

This doesn't work under symex-driven lazy loading because no entry-point function is given.
