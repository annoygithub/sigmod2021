When B.f is called on `c.a_field`, it is guarded by a conditional which implies
that `c.a_field` must be a B. Symex should filter the value set for `c.a_field`
to remove anything which doesn't satisfy that condition. It will then be able
to determine that the return value of B.f is 9. If it thinks that `c.a_field`
might contain an A then it will create a more complicated expression for the
return value of B.f, which will include byte_extract_little_endian or
byte_extract_big_endian, as this is what it will produce when trying to read
the field `int flag` from a class that doesn't have any fields.
