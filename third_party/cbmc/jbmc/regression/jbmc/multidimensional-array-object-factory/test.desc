This checks that no \$object or invalid_object references are generated when creating a multidimensional
array (required for My.func's input parameter, which is an int[][]). Both of the unwanted terms are used
by goto-symex to describe the result of a failed or unknown pointer dereference, and the object factory's
initialisation code should be clear enough that this is never necessary.
