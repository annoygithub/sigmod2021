This tests that there is no invariant violation when modifying the values on the
stack. in this case the `position` variable is used as index in an array via the
Java equivalent of

 buffer[position++];

The code pushes position, duplicates it and the modifies the stack
entry. Before, the stack entry generation removed typecasts which gave a typing
problem with the `iand` operator
