^Passing problem to
^warning: ignoring
--
The "Passing problem to..." line is a sign that symex couldn't prove the
assertion is valid by itself, which in turn probably indicates a weakness of the
expression simplifier. The companion test_no_propagation.desc checks that the
"Passing problem to" line is indeed present when we indeed resort to the SAT
solver.
